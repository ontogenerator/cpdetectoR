Description: An R implementation of the learning curve analysis method published in Gallistel et al. (2004).
  From a sequence of responses the changes in response (e.g. from one response frequency to another or from
	one response level to another) are estimated using different statistical tests and a threshold criterion.
	Currently only discrete binary responses are handled. Contact the author if you would like to request
	the implementation of continuous responses.
